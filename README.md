Smart vehicle system using can bus refers to a system that utilizes the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus communication protocol in vehicles. This system is designed to provide warnings about approaching vehicles, likely employing sensors and data from the CAN bus to detect nearby vehicles. Additionally, it includes an incident logger that records relevant data during incidents. The logged information is then stored on a cloud-based platform.
